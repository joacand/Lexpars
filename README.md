# Lexpars

Lexpars is a lexer and parser for a small language made without the use of any external tools.

Lexical analysis and parsing is all done "by hand", using only the standard C++ libraries.

The motivation for the project is mainly educational, to gain more experience using C++ and learn more about how the front-end of a compiler works.

## Features
Basic statements and expression have been implemented.

### Todo
* Extend the lexer and parser with more statements and expressions

### Future work
Future work may include extending the project to a full compiler, with type checking and code generation.

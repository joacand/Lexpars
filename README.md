# No Tools Compiler

No Tools Compiler is a compiler for a small language made without the use of any external tools.

Lexical analysis, parsing etc. is all done by hand, using only the standard C++ libraries.

The motivation for the project is mainly educational, to gain more experience using C++ and learn more about how all the different parts of a compiler work.

## Features
So far only a small lexer and parser have been implemented (the front end of the compiler).

### Todo
* Extend the lexer and parser
* Add type checker
* Back-end
